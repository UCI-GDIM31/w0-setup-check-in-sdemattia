# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
    >My name is Sophia DeMattia and I use she/her pronouns. I have no prior experience with coding games (besides using scratch back in middle school) but I am a GDIM major and desperately need to learn. Despite this being a required course for my major, I am excited to learn the basics of programming games.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
    >A base level knowledge that I can continue to add to throughout the rest of my classes.
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
    >I am not too nervous about this class, currently at least.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
    >I have some experience in Python and Java but I don't remember most of it.

2. Game development (any engine)
    >N/A

3. Unity
    >N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**
